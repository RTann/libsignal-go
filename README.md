# libsignal-go

A pure Go implementation of https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal.

This repository is meant to be broken down into different
APIs similar to the source repository.

Only libsignal-protocol is implemented at this time, 
and it does not support groups at this time.

This repository is still under development, so
breaking changes should be expected.

## Roadmap

* Add and refactor tests
* Add group support to libsignal-protocol.
* Add CI
* Implement other APIs available in the source repository.
